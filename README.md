Hey my name is Dan and I'm interested in infrastructure / system adminstration / applications development. I've never collaborated on any projects, but I'm interested in helping in projects if its within my skillset. Right now i'm learning the basics of linux / Bash / C.

If you'd like to contact me, please reach me at:
