Hey my name is Dan and I'm interested in infristructure / adminstration. I've never collaborated on any projects, but I'm interested in helping in projects if its within my skillset. As I said right now i'm learning the basics of linux but after the basics, i'm interested in building games and exploring servers.

If you'd like to contact me, please reach me at:

Thanks for stopping by and if your interested in looking over my code and giving me critiques i'd be very gratef\ul.
