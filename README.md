-Hey my name is Dan, Skooped or BigCircles depending on where you've met me. I'm interested in picking up the basics of python and then begin to build things I 
really enjoy. I've never collaborated on any projects, but I'm interested in helping in projects if its within my skillset. As I said right now i'm learning the basics
of Python, but after the basics, i'm interested in building games and exploring servers.

If you'd like to contact me, please reach me at:

Thanks for stopping by and if your interested in looking over my code and giving me critiques i'd be very greatful.
